~Synopsis :

  """
    Python Matching is a Free, experimental project that aims to
    offer a Ocaml-like PatternMatching on Python structures like
    lists, dic, set, int, string, etc... You can either use it to
    compare two structures, or to implement some basic recursive
    functions such as Fact, Fibo, etc... (eg in the test file).
  """


~HowTo :

  - You can include this module in any Python Project.
  - You MUST use *Python 3.x*
  - PythonMatching allows you to create a "matcher", which
  is an object initialized with as many patterns as you want,
  and which is able to be called on any structure.

  ex :

    my_matcher = Match(
                       pattern0, 'action0',
                       pattern1, 'action1',
                       ...)
    print(my_matcher(my_struct))
